# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [23.4.0] - 2023-04-17

### Added

- Generate OLM bundle ([#645]).
- Cluster status conditions ([#658])
- Extend cluster resources for status and cluster operation (paused, stopped) ([#660]).

### Changed

- [BREAKING] Support specifying Service type.
  This enables us to later switch non-breaking to using `ListenerClasses` for the exposure of Services.
  This change is breaking, because - for security reasons - we default to the `cluster-internal` `ListenerClass`.
  If you need your cluster to be accessible from outside of Kubernetes you need to set `clusterConfig.listenerClass`
  to `external-unstable` ([#661]).
- Deploy default and support custom affinities ([#649]).
- Operator-rs: `0.36.0` -> `0.40.2` ([#660], [#663], [#665]).
- Use operator-rs `build_rbac_resources` method ([#665]).

### Fixed

- Bugfix: java heap format ([#651]).
- Fixed operator error when creating the ZNode in a different namespace than the ZookeeperCluster ([#653]).
- Avoid empty log events dated to 1970-01-01 and improve the precision of the
  log event timestamps ([#663]).

## [0.10.0] - 2022-06-23

### Added

- Reconciliation errors are now reported as Kubernetes events ([#408]).

### Changed

- Operator-rs: 0.10.0 -> 0.21.1 ([#408], [#431], [#434], [#454], [#479], [#490]).
- [BREAKING] Specifying the product version has been changed to adhere to [ADR018](https://docs.stackable.tech/home/contributor/adr/ADR018-product_image_versioning.html) instead of just specifying the product version you will now have to add the Stackable image version as well, so `version: 3.5.8` becomes (for example) `version: 3.5.8-stackable0.1.0` ([#487])

### Added

- `process_command` to reconcile loop for command handling ([#223]).
- `rust/crd/lib/command.rs` for command CRDs
- Trait implementations for command handling for the cluster and status ([#223]):
  - `HasCurrentCommand` to manipulate the current_command in the status

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where `wait_until_crds_present` only reacted to the main CRD, not the commands ([#251]).
- The ZooKeeper discovery now correctly uses the "client" container port from the pod instead of defaulting to 2181 which will only work if the default port is used ([#230]).
