## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.1] - 2021-10-27


### Added
- `process_command` to reconcile loop for command handling ([#223]).
- `rust/crd/lib/command.rs` for command CRDs
- Trait implementations for command handling for the cluster and status ([#223]):
  - `HasCurrentCommand` to manipulate the current_command in the status
  - `HasClusterExecutionStatus` to access cluster_execution_status in the status
  - `HasRoleRestartOrder` to determine the restart order of different roles
  - `HasCommands` to provide all supported commands like Restart, Start, Stop ...
  - `CanBeRolling` to perform a rolling restart
  - `HasRoles` to run a command only on a subset of roles
- Generated CRDs for Restart, Start, Stop ([#223]).
- Example custom resources for Restart, Start, Stop ([#223]).

### Changed
- Switched to operator-rs tag 0.3.0 ([#251])
- Use `identity::LabeledPodIdentityFactory` to generate pod ids. ([#217])
- Fix `ZookeeperCluster` conditions overwriting each other ([#228])
- BREAKING: renamed crd/util.rs to crd/discovery.rs ([#230]).

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where `wait_until_crds_present` only reacted to the main CRD, not the commands ([#251]).
- The ZooKeeper discovery now correctly uses the "client" container port from the pod instead of defaulting to 2181 which will only work if the default port is used ([#230]).
