  # This job evaluates the github environment to determine why this action is running and selects the appropriate
  # target repository for published Helm charts based on this.
  #
  # The following scenarios are identified:
  #    - pull request:
  #        condition: github.event_name == "pull_request"
  #        repository: test
  #
  #    - release (aka a tag was created):
  #         condition: github.event_name == 'create' & github.ref.startswith('refs/tags/')
  #         repository: stable
  #
  #    - merge of pr to main branch:
  #         condition: github.event_name == 'push' & github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  #         repository: dev
  #
  # Any other scenarios will cause the publish step to be skipped, most commonly this is expected to happen for the
  # branches that bors uses internally (staging, trying) for which the checks need to run, but we do not want artifacts
  # to be published.

  # This job cleans up the CRDs, Helm charts and Kustomize manifests, followed by rebuilding them
  # It then runs a `git diff` and fails the entire workflow, if any difference is encountered.
  #
  # Since CRD files are generated during the 'cargo build' process we need to run this once after
  # removing the CRD files to ensure that the checked in versions match what the code expects.
  #
  # The reason for this step is, that developers are expected to check in up-to-date versions of charts
  # and manifests, as we'd otherwise have to build these in CI and commit them back to the PR, which
  # creates all kinds of problems.
  # Therefor this failsafe simply aborts anything that has not had charts and manifests rebuilt before pushing.
