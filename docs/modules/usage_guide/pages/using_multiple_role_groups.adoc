= Using multiple role groups

// abstract/summary
ZooKeeper uses a unique ID called _myid_ to identify each server in the cluster. The Stackable Operator for Apache ZooKeeper assigns the _myid_ to each Pod from the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#ordinal-index[ordinal index] given to the Pod by Kubernetes. This index is unique over the Pods in the StatefulSet of the xref:home:concepts:roles-and-role-groups.adoc[role group].

When using multiple role groups in a cluster, this will lead to different ZooKeeper Pods using the same _myid_. Each role group is represented by its own StatefulSet, and therefore always identified starting with `0`.

In order to avoid this _myid_ conflict, a property `myidOffset` needs to be specified in each rolegroup. The `myidOffset` defaults to zero, but if specified will be added to the ordinal index of the Pod.

== Example configuration

Here the property is used on the second role group in a ZooKeeperCluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: zookeeper.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: ZookeeperCluster
metadata:
  name: zookeeper
spec:
  servers:
    roleGroups:
      primary:
        replicas: 2
      secondary:
        replicas: 1
        config:
          myidOffset: 10  # <1>
```

<1> The `myidOffset` property set to 10 for the secondary role group

The `secondary` role group _myid_ starts from id `10`. The `primary` role group will start from `0`. This means, the replicas of the role group `primary` should not be scaled higher than `10` which results in `10` `primary` Pods using a _myid_ from `0` to `9`, followed by the `secondary` Pods starting at _myid_ `10`.
