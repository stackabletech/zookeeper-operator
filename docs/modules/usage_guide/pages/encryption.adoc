= Encryption

The quorum and client communication are encrypted by default via TLS. This requires the xref:secret-operator::index.adoc[Secret Operator] to be present in order to provide certificates. The utilized certificates can be changed in a top-level config.

[source,yaml]

<1> The `tls.secretClass` refers to the client-to-server encryption. Defaults to the `tls` secret.
<2> The `quorumTlsSecretClass` refers to the server-to-server quorum encryption. Defaults to the `tls` secret.

The `tls` secret is deployed from the xref:secret-operator::index.adoc[Secret Operator] and looks like this:

[source,yaml]

You can create your own secrets and reference them e.g. in the `tls.secretClass` to use different certificates.
