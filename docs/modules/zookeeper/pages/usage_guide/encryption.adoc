:description: Quorum and client communication in ZooKeeper are encrypted via TLS by default. Customize certificates with the Secret Operator for added security

The quorum and client communication are encrypted by default via TLS.
This requires the xref:secret-operator:index.adoc[Secret Operator] to be present in order to provide certificates.
The utilized certificates can be changed in a top-level config.

[source,yaml]

<1> The `tls.server.secretClass` refers to the client-to-server encryption. Defaults to the `tls` secret.
<2> The `tls.quorum.secretClass` refers to the server-to-server quorum encryption. Defaults to the `tls` secret.

The `tls` secret is deployed from the xref:secret-operator:index.adoc[Secret Operator] and looks like this:

You can create your own secrets and reference them e.g. in the `tls.secretClass` to use different certificates.
