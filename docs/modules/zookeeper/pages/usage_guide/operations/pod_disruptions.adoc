= Allowed Pod disruptions

You can configure the allowed Pod disruptions for Zookeeper nodes as described in xref:concepts:operations/pod_disruptions.adoc[].

Unless you configure something else or disable our PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs), we write the following PDBs:

== Servers

Zookeeper servers need a certain number of nodes to be available to form a quorum to serve client requests.

Taking this into consideration, our operator uses the following algorithm to determine the maximum number of servers allowed to be unavailable at the same time:

`num_servers` is the number of server in the Zookeeper cluster, summed over all `roleGroups`.

[source,rust]
----
// Minimum required amount of servers to form quorum.
let quorum_size = quorum_size(num_servers);

// Subtract once to not cause a single point of failure
let max_unavailable = num_servers.saturating_sub(quorum_size).saturating_sub(1);

// Clamp to at least a single node allowed to being, to not block Kubernetes nodes from draining.
let max_unavailable = max(max_unavailable, 1)
----

This results e.g. in the following numbers:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Number of servers
|Maximum unavailable servers
