= Log aggregation

The logs can be forwarded to a Vector log aggregator by providing a discovery
ConfigMap for the aggregator and by enabling the log agent:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    vectorAggregatorConfigMapName: vector-aggregator-discovery
  servers:
    config:
      logging:
        enableVectorAgent: true
        containers:
          prepare:
            console:
              level: INFO
            file:
              level: INFO
            loggers:
              ROOT:
                level: INFO
    roleGroups:
      default:
        replicas: 1
