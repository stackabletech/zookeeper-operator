= Service exposition with ListenerClasses

Apache ZooKeeper offers an API. The Operator deploys a service called `<name>` (where `<name>` is the name of the ZookeeperCluster) through which ZooKeeper can be reached.

The operator deploys a xref:listener-operator:listener.adoc[Listener] for the Server pod.
The listener defaults to only being accessible from within the Kubernetes cluster, but this can be changed by setting `.spec.nodes.config.listenerClass`:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  servers:
    config:
      listenerClass: external-unstable  # <1>
----
<1> Specify one of `external-stable`, `external-unstable`, `cluster-internal` (the default setting is `cluster-internal`).
