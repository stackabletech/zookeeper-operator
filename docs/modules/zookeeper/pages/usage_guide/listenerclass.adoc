= Service exposition with ListenerClasses
:description: Configure the ZooKeeper service exposure with listener classes: cluster-internal, external-unstable or external-stable

Apache ZooKeeper offers an API. The Operator deploys a service called `<name>` (where `<name>` is the name of the ZookeeperCluster) through which ZooKeeper can be reached.

The operator deploys a xref:listener-operator:listener.adoc[Listener] for the Server pods.
The listener defaults to only being accessible from within the Kubernetes cluster, but this can be changed by setting `.spec.servers.roleConfig.listenerClass`:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  servers:
    roleConfig:
      listenerClass: external-unstable  # <1>
----
<1> Specify one of `external-stable`, `external-unstable`, `cluster-internal` (the default setting is `cluster-internal`).
