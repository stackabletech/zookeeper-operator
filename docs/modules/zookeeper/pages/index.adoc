= Stackable Operator for Apache ZooKeeper

The Stackable Operator for Apache ZooKeeper is a Kubernetes Operator for deploying and managing https://zookeeper.apache.org/[Apache ZooKeeper] ensembles.
Apache ZooKeeper is an open-source distributed coordination service that facilitates synchronization, configuration management and leader election in distributed systems.
ZooKeeper is often used for these tasks in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. Within the Stackable Platform, the Stackable Operators for xref:hbase:index.adoc[Apache HBase], xref:hdfs:index.adoc[Apache Hadoop HDFS], xref:kafka:index.adoc[Apache Kafka] and xref:nifi:index.adoc[Apache NiFi] depend on the ZooKeeper Operator.

== Getting started

Get started with Apache ZooKeeper and the Stackable Operator by following the xref:getting_started/index.adoc[Getting started] guide, it will guide you through the xref:getting_started/installation.adoc[installation] process. Afterwards consult the xref:usage_guide/index.adoc[Usage guide] to learn more about configuring ZooKeeper for your needs. You can also deploy a <<demos, demo>> to see an example deployment of ZooKeeper together with other data products.

== Operator model

The Operator manages two custom resources: _ZookeeperCluster_ and _ZookeeperZnode_. ZooKeeper only has a single process that it runs, so the cluster resource only has a single corresponding xref:concepts:roles-and-role-groups.adoc[role] called _server_.

For every role group the Operator creates a ConfigMap and StatefulSet which can have multiple replicas (Pods). Every role group is accessible through itâ€™s own Service, and there is a Service for the whole Cluster.

The operator creates a xref:concepts:service_discovery.adoc[service discovery ConfigMap] for the ZooKeeper instance, as well as for each ZNode. The discovery ConfigMaps contain information on how to connect to ZooKeeper. The ZNode discovery ConfigMap give access information for the ZNode. xref:zookeeper:znodes.adoc[learn more about ZNodes].

== Dependencies

Apache ZooKeeper has no dependencies.

== [[demos]]Demos

Apache ZooKeeper is a dependency of xref:hbase:index.adoc[Apache HBase], xref:hdfs:index.adoc[Apache Hadoop HDFS], xref:kafka:index.adoc[Apache Kafka] and xref:nifi:index.adoc[Apache NiFi], thus any demo that uses one or more of these components will also deploy a ZooKeeper ensemble. Here is the list of the demos that include ZooKeeper:

* xref:stackablectl::demos/data-lakehouse-iceberg-trino-spark.adoc[]
* xref:stackablectl::demos/hbase-hdfs-load-cycling-data.adoc[]
* xref:stackablectl::demos/jupyterhub-pyspark-hdfs-anomaly-detection-taxi-data.adoc[]
* xref:stackablectl::demos/logging.adoc[]
* xref:stackablectl::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data.adoc[]
* xref:stackablectl::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-water-level-data.adoc[]

== Supported Versions

The Stackable Operator for Apache ZooKeeper currently supports the following versions of ZooKeeper:
