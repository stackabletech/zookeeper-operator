= Getting started

This guide gets you started with Apache ZooKeeper using the Stackable Operator.
It guides you through the installation of the Operator and its dependencies, setting up your first ZooKeeper cluster and connecting to it as well as setting up your first xref:znodes.adoc[ZNode].

== Prerequisites

You need:

* a Kubernetes cluster
* kubectl
* optional: Helm

Resource sizing depends on cluster type(s), usage and scope, but as a starting point a minimum of the following resources is recommended for this operator:

* 0.2 cores (e.g. i5 or similar)
* 256MB RAM

== What's next

The Guide is divided into two steps:

* xref:getting_started/installation.adoc[Installing the Operators].
* xref:getting_started/first_steps.adoc[Setting up the ZooKeeper cluster].
