Each `ZookeeperZnode` gets an isolated ZNode chroot, which the `ZOOKEEPER` automatically contains. All data inside of this chroot will be deleted when the corresponding `ZookeeperZnode` is.\n\n`ZookeeperZnode` is *not* designed to manage the contents of this ZNode. Instead, it should be used to create a chroot for an installation of an application to work inside. Initializing the contents is the responsibility of the application."
